            <h1>Game Instructions:</h1>
            <p>In this game you will go back in time to save the world from an impending doom. You must overcome a number of challenges and depending on which challenge you overcome you will receive varying number of materials which you will need to win the game. You will need at least 10 materials to pass the game but materials alone will not determine wether you win or lose, you will also need to guess which year you have been teleported to. The aim is to win each individual challenge and remember each clue you gather along the way. In some challenges you will have the option to play or forfeit. Remember that if you forfeit and complete an easier challenge you will receive less materials for that win compared to if you take on and beat the more difficult challenge.

                <h1>Outline of development</h1>
                <ol class="lists">
                    <li>We began with the brainstorm. We were given 3 options for inspiration and we decided to go with the time travel theme but we also liked the idea of having an ogre look for a missing donkey so we added that into our storyline too.</li>
                    <li>Once we had a basic idea we came up with a plot and wrote some lore. The plot became the skeleton to house the minigames in.</li>
                    <li>We used Trello to split up jobs and then used Figma to organise all the directions the game could go.</li>
                    <li>We then began the difficult and interesting job of coding the mini games.We planned 4 minigames: tic tac toe, rock paper scissors, the tower of hanoi and blackjack.
                    </li>
                    <li>Once we had coded the minigames we seperated them in classes and integrated them into the story skeleton.
                    </li>
                    <li>We finished with the writing, adding details from the games.
                    </li>
                    <li>We had a lot of time left at this point so we added ASCII art and some extra functionality to the blackjack.
                    </li>
                    <li>Finally we playtested the game trying to look for bugs and shared it with the other team to test as well.
                    </li>
                    <li>Once the final bugs were sorted we were finished.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h1>What went well</h1>
                <p>All team members with different levels of experience in coding came together in a very collaborative manner to participate in this project that showcased their strengths in their own ways. The main credit to the result of our project would have to be given to our consistent communication all throughout. The team also catered each others for their weaknesses when challenges occurred. Overall, this project was a success due to great team work.</p>

                <h1>What we would do different</h1>
                <p>It was fairly confusing to move the blackjack game into a class after coding it all as seperate functions. Next time we will code with classes in mind from the start. We would also split the blackjack game into smaller methods because it makes the code much more readable and easy to work with. Sound effects and music would have been nice too but we were limited on time.
