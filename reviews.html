            <summary>The Guardian - 10/10</summary>
            <p>I'm not exaggerating in the slightest when I say "Lost in Time" is the 'best game of all time'.  Super Mario, Portal, Halo... every other game out there just pales in comparison to this masterpiece from Team Green. I don't think I will ever play another game in my life unless it is a sequel to this game.</p>

            <summary>IGN - 10/10</summary>
            <p>This game is one of a kind. You will rarely see a game which boasts creativity, ingenuity and graphics quite like "lost in time". It is a masterpiece. The best game I have played in my life.</p>

            <summary>New York Times - 9/10</summary>
            <p>Lost in Time is a modern masterpiece.
                The developers have continued the work of the Old Masters bringing beauty in this world.
                I would give it a perfect score except the ogre is definitely cheating at rock paper scissors. How can I lose every time at a game with 50/50 chance?

            <summary>Zero Punctuation - 0/10</summary>
            <p>The hero of this game is silly. If you went back in time to medieval times you could teach them hygiene and build technology, greatly improving the world.
                Instead they play various games with locals then abandon them as soon as they can.
                If I had a time machine I would go back and stop the developers from making this piece of c**p.
